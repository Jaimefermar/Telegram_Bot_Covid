# Telegram_Bot_Covid
Telegram bot in google script and google sheets to control access to a students local at the university.

The bot I´ve created is hosted in the google cloud for free, because it uses google script which is included with all the free google accounts. The main function of it it´s to complement the google form created to control the access due to Covid-19. I´ve created it because scanning a QR code every time you access the local is quite frustrating and giving your personal info even more and that makes people not to register the access, so the traceability is much more complicated.

The main sheet in which the bot writes information is generated after the google form is created to make both methods totally compatible, because we can’t force everyone to have the Telegram bot.
